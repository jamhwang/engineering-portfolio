# Engineering Portfolio

Production-style engineering projects focused on cloud automation, endpoint management, and security operations.

This repository serves as a curated portfolio of practical, hands-on work that reflects real-world operational scenarios rather than academic exercises. Projects emphasize reliability, automation, and clear problem-solving approaches commonly used in enterprise environments.

---

## Focus Areas

- **Cloud Automation**
  - AWS EC2, IAM, Systems Manager (SSM)
  - Infrastructure and operational task automation
  - Least-privilege access and observability

- **Endpoint Management**
  - Windows and macOS endpoint lifecycle workflows
  - Configuration, provisioning, and remediation automation
  - Policy enforcement concepts (Intune, Jamf, GPO)

- **Security Operations**
  - Endpoint security triage and response workflows
  - Detection, validation, and remediation playbooks
  - Operational support aligned with Tier-2 / Tier-3 environments

## Featured Projects

### 🔹 AWS Systems Manager Automation Toolkit
**Technologies:** AWS EC2, SSM, IAM, Python  
Automated common operational tasks, including remote command execution, inventory collection, and patch workflows. Designed with least-privilege IAM roles and a focus on reducing manual intervention across distributed environments.

---

### 🔹 Endpoint Provisioning & Remediation Automation
**Technologies:** PowerShell, Windows, AWS SSM  
Built automation workflows to standardize endpoint setup and remediation steps. Reduced manual configuration effort and improved consistency across endpoint deployments.

---

### 🔹 Endpoint Security Response Playbooks
**Technologies:** CrowdStrike Falcon, PowerShell  
Documented and automated response workflows for common endpoint security scenarios, including detection triage, containment validation, and remediation steps. Focused on clarity and repeatability for operational support teams.

---

## Design Principles

- Production-minded, not demo-driven
- Clear problem statements and scope
- Minimal dependencies and explicit assumptions
- Emphasis on maintainability and operational clarity
